sCCS, or StudioCCS is the early stages of a program that I hope will become a fully featured toolkit for working with CC2's CCS files.

Currently, it's features are limted to Model Viewing and dumping.

There are two viewport modes in sCCS, the Preview Viewport, and the Scene Viewport.
The Preview Viewport contains a tree view that shows all of the currently loaded CCS files.
The following sub items are currently displayed for loaded CCS files:
-Clumps(Skeletons)
-Objects(Bones)
-Meshses
