**Another Blog**
Here's another blog that I probably won't update, but I'll try since it is supposed to pertain to updates for sCCS, and any other projects I may be working on.

**Recent updates to sCCS:**
Don't really have a version number system in place, but the latest version of sCCS includes minor fixes to allow more files to load.
Will try to get a much easier system for releases and updates in place in the coming days.
